              <p>This is the Privacy Policy governing your use of the NingboExport 
                Site. By using this Site, you consent to our Privacy Policy set 
                out below. All terms not defined in this document have the meanings 
                ascribed to them in the Terms of Use Agreement between you and 
                NingboExport which by use of this Site you agree to accept. </p>
              <p>1. The Information We Collect </p>
              <p>1.1 Registration Information. At the time you register to become 
                a Registered User of the Site, you will be asked to fill out a 
                registration form which requires you provide information such 
                as your name, address, phone/fax number, email address and other 
                personal information as well as information about your business 
                (&quot;Registration Information&quot;). </p>
              <p>1.2 Publishing Information. If you submit any information to 
                NingboExport to be published on the Site through the publishing 
                tools, including but not limited to Company Profile, Product Catalog, 
                Trade Leads, TrustPass Profile and any discussion forum, then 
                you are deemed to have given consent to the publication of such 
                information (&quot;Publishing Information&quot;). </p>
              <p>1.3 Statistical Information. In addition, we gather aggregate 
                statistical information about our Site and Users, such as IP addresses, 
                browser software, operating system, pages viewed, number of sessions 
                and unique visitors, etc. (&quot;Statistical Information&quot;). 
              </p>
              <p>1.4 Registration Information, Publishing Information, Statistical 
                Information and any information we may collect from you through 
                the use of cookies (see Section 5 below) or any other means shall 
                collectively be referred to as &quot;Collected Information&quot;. 
              </p>
              <p>2. How We May Use Information </p>
              <p>2.1 General. We use your Collected Information to improve our 
                marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site 
                usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize 
                our Site's content, layout and service specifically for you. We 
                may use your Collected Information to service your Account with 
                us, including but not limited to investigating problems, resolving 
                disputes and enforcing agreements with us. We do not sell, rent, 
                trade or exchange any personally-identifying information of our 
                Users. We may share certain aggregate information based on analysis 
                of Collected Information with our partners, customers, advertisers 
                or potential Users. We may use your Collected Information to execute 
                marketing campaigns, promotions or advertising messages on behalf 
                of third parties; however, in these circumstances, your Collected 
                Information will not be disclosed to such third parties unless 
                you respond to the marketing, promotion or advertising message. 
              </p>
              <p>2.2 Registration Information. We may use your Registration Information 
                to provide services that you request or to contact you regarding 
                additional services about which NingboExport determines that you 
                might be interested. Specifically, we may use your email address, 
                mailing address, phone number or fax number to contact you regarding 
                notices, surveys, product alerts, new service or product offerings 
                and communications relevant to your use of our Site. We may generate 
                reports and analysis based on the Registration Information for 
                internal analysis, monitoring and marketing decisions. </p>
              <p>2.3 Publishing Information. All of your Publishing Information 
                will be publicly available on the Site and therefore accessible 
                by any internet user. Any Publishing Information that you disclose 
                to NingboExport becomes public information and you relinquish 
                any proprietary rights (including but not limited to the rights 
                of confidentiality and copyrights) in such information. You should 
                exercise caution when deciding to include personal or proprietary 
                information in the Publishing Information that you submit to us. 
              </p>
              <p>2.4 Statistical Information. We use Statistical Information to 
                help diagnose problems with and maintain our computer servers, 
                to manage our Site, and to enhance our Site and services based 
                on the usage pattern data we receive. We may generate reports 
                and analysis based on the Statistical Information for internal 
                analysis, monitoring and marketing decisions. We may provide Statistical 
                Information to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide 
                personally-identifying information without your permission. </p>
              <p>3. Disclosure of Information </p>
              <p>3.1 We reserve the right to disclose your Collected Information 
                to relevant authorities where we have reason to believe that such 
                disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action 
                against someone who may be infringing or threatening to infringe, 
                or who may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with, 
                the title, rights, interests or property of NingboExport, our 
                Users, customers, partners, other web site users or anyone else 
                who could be harmed by such activities. </p>
              <p>3.2 We also reserve the right to disclose Collected Information 
                in response to a subpoena or other judicial order or when we reasonably 
                believe that such disclosure is required by law, regulation or 
                administrative order of any court, governmental or regulatory 
                authority. </p>
              <p>3.3 If we have reason to believe that a User is in breach of 
                the Terms of User Agreement or any other agreement with us, then 
                we reserve the right to make public or otherwise disclose such 
                User's Collected Information in order to pursue our claim or prevent 
                further injury to NingboExport or others. </p>
              <p>4. Co-Branded Relationships </p>
              <p>We have established relationships with other parties to offer 
                you the benefit of other products and services which we ourselves 
                do not offer. We offer you access to these other parties either 
                through the use of hyperlinks to their sites from our Site, or 
                through offering &quot;co-branded&quot; sites in which both ourselves 
                and these other parties share the same uniform resource locator, 
                domain name or pages within a domain name on the Internet. In 
                some cases you may be required to submit information for purposes 
                of registering or applying for products or services provided by 
                such third parties or co-branded partners. The privacy policy 
                of such other parties may differ from ours, and we may not have 
                any control over the information that you submit to such third 
                parties or co-branded sites. We therefore encourage you to read 
                that policy before responding to any offers, products or services 
                provided by such other parties. </p>
              <p>5. Cookies </p>
              <p>5.1 We use &quot;cookies&quot; to store specific information 
                about you and track your visits to our Site. It is not uncommon 
                for web sites to use cookies to enhance identification of their 
                users. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small amount of data that is 
                sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
                A cookie can be sent to your computer's hard drive only if you 
                access our Site using the computer. If you do not de-activate 
                or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access 
                our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our 
                Site and in turn we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern 
                of your usage. Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable 
                us to access your Registration Information, Publishing Information 
                or Payment Information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather 
                statistical information about usage by Users; research visiting 
                patters and help target advertisements based on User interests; 
                assist our partners to track User visits to the Site and process 
                orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. </p>
              <p>5.2 You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by 
                configuring your browser's which is installed in the computer 
                you are using to access the Site. If you desire, you can change 
                those configurations in your browser. By setting your preferences 
                in the browser, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified 
                when a cookie is sent, or you can reject all cookies. If you reject 
                all cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function in your 
                browser, you may be required to re-enter your information on our 
                Site more often and certain features of our Site may be unavailable. 
              </p>
              <p>6. Minors </p>
              <p>The Site and its contents are not intended to be targeted to 
                minors under applicable law and we do not intend to sell any of 
                our products or services to minors. However, we have no way of 
                distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Site and 
                so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all 
                ages. If a minor has provided us with personal information without 
                parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact 
                us to remove the information. </p>
              <p>7. Security Measures </p>
              <p>7.1 We employ commercially reasonable security methods to prevent 
                unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct 
                use of information. </p>
              <p>7.2 As a Registered User, your Registration Information, Publishing 
                Information and Payment Information (if any) can be viewed and 
                edited through your Account which is protected by Password. We 
                recommend that you do not divulge your Password to anyone. Our 
                personnel will never ask you for your Password in an unsolicited 
                phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. If you share a computer 
                with others, you should not choose to save your log-in information 
                (e.g., User ID and Password) on the computer. Remember to sign 
                out of your Account and close your browser window when you have 
                finished your session. </p>
              <p>7.3 No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network 
                can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while 
                we try to protect your information, no web site or company, including 
                ourselves, can absolutely ensure or guarantee the security of 
                any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. 
              </p>
              <p>8. Changes to Privacy Policy </p>
              <p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated through 
                our posting an amended and restated Privacy Policy on our Site.
